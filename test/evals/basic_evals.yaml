          I want to install an OCP cluster
        expected_response: |
          I can help you create an OpenShift cluster. I need some more information first. What would you like the cluster to be named? What is the base domain for the cluster? What OpenShift version do you want to install? Do you want to create a single-node cluster?

          Hello! I am Assisted Installer Chat, created by Red Hat. How can I help you today? To create an OpenShift
          cluster, I need a few more details. Could you please provide the following:

          • The desired cluster name
          • The base domain for the cluster
          • The OpenShift version you'd like to install
          • Whether you want a single-node cluster or a multi-node cluster
      - prompt: |
          The name should be foo, the domain: foo.bar and the version should be the default version
        expected_response: "OK. The default version is 4.19.1. Is this a single node cluster?"
